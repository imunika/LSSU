Over his career he developed a number of exhibitions from the permanent collection including examinations of Berenice Abbott, James McNeill Whistler, W. Eugene Smith and Ivan Mestrovic. Group shows investigated narrative art, artist colonies at Gloucester and Provincetown and artist portraits and self-portraits. He also created several loan exhibitions, most notably one on Winslow Homer and another in 2011, <em>Run and Tell That</em>, that brought to campus new work by emerging New York artists. His most recent exhibition, <em>Forbidden Fruit: Yasuo Kuniyoshi’s America</em>, was an in depth examination of the Japanese American artist incorporating works from the permanent collection and loans from MoMA, the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Johnson Museum at Cornell University. He is currently working on <em>The Howling Infinite: Moby Dick, Art and the Environment</em>, an interdisciplinary exhibition using Melville’s epic narrative to examine American landscape art and the current marine environmental crisis.</p>

      <p class="drop-cap mt-5">MOBY-DICK; or, THE WHALE, by Herman Melville ostensibly recounts Captain Ahab’s retributive search for the great white whale seen through the eyes of Ishmael, a crewmember on Ahab’s whaling ship <em>Pequod</em>. Immediately, however, groundwork is laid through an etymology and a series of extracts (supplied by a “Sub-Sub-Librarian”) for a grander, more subtle discourse on the subject of whales and whaling. Descriptions abound, of New Bedford and Father Mapple, Nantucket and chowder, the ship and its crew, cetology, in detail, and much more. We journey across the Atlantic to the Azores, down to and around the Cape of Good Hope and across the Southern Indian Ocean into the Pacific. There, over three days commences the final confrontation between Ahab and the white leviathan, culminating in the ship’s sinking and the deaths of all aboard except Ishmael who is saved by Queequeg’s floating coffin.</p>
      <p>Now envision an installation constructed by undergraduate students (under faculty supervision) of a 75 foot sperm whale, made from white plastic shopping bags. Suspended from the gallery entrance’s ceiling, it will tower over a 30 foot whaling dory pieced together from plastic water bottles and plastic straws and floating on a sea of Styrofoam clam shell containers. Thus, the link is made between Melville and our contemporary environment.</p>

      </figure>
      <br>
      <p>The exhibition’s inspiration is Robert Swain Gifford’s 1895 painting, <em>The Loss of the Essex by a Sperm Whale</em> from the Syracuse University Art Galleries’ permanent collection. The image describes the 1820 sinking of the whaling ship <em>Essex</em> from a whale attack, cited by many as Melville’s narrative inspiration. Several other objects from the collection illustrate Melville’s story in ways didactic, philosophical, or both. For example, Winslow Homer’s wood engravings, <em>Winter at Sea - Taking in Sail Off the Coast</em>, 1869 and <em>The Wreck of the "Atlantic"- Cast up by the Sea</em>, 1873 graphically illustrate the difficulties and dangers confronting those who went to sea in the 19th century.</p>

      <br>
      <p>One danger, a ship’s proximity to shore in a storm, is described in chapter 23, The Lee Shore, <em>“Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that’s kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship’s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through"</em>.</p>

      <br>     
      <p>Wynn Bullock metaphysically captures Melville’s …<em>one touch of land</em>, in his large gelatin silver print, <em>Point Lobos Wave</em>, 1958. Bullock’s aesthetic decisions correlate effectively with Melville’s ironic tone as the exposure reveals the ocean’s beauty and power and printing the image right to the paper’s edge affords the viewer no marginal relief. Likewise, Anne Ryan’s decision to print on black wove paper her 1947color woodcut, <em>Now, Ever Awake, My Master Dear, I Fear a Deadly Storm</em>, accentuates the title’s ominous undertone, another narrative device found throughout the novel.</p>

      </figure>
      <br>
      <p>Borrowed objects from other collections will enable a broader and more contemporary aesthetic context. Leonard Baskin called Moby Dick, “our greatest novel,” and in 1970 with Gehanna Press published a portfolio of eight color lithographs titled <em><b>The Moby Dick Suite</b></em>. Without text, context, and in no determined order, the artist presented a personal interpretation of the novels’ central characters. Baskin’s singular style emphasizes Ahab’s physical (and psychic) deformities caused by his first encounter with the white whale. The artist conceived Moby Dick on a larger horizontal plate, isolating him on an indeterminate background to acknowledge his oversized place in the narrative and to reference the leviathan’s broader philosophical context.</p>

      </figure>
      <br>
      <p>Current environmental issues and their impact on seas and oceans are an equally necessary component of the exhibition. More than data alone, art can viscerally affect a visitor’s psyche and illuminate and focus attention. Joan Hall, for example, has long been concerned with the world’s oceans deteriorating condition. Her mixed media sculpture and handmade paper works like <em>Global Warming</em>, 2016 represent the types of human made trash accumulating in international waters.</p>

      <p>Nick Pumphrey is an Australian photographer who captures images that document nature, the beauty and fragility of the sea and coastal culture. Among his subjects are images of swimmers and sea life in a plastic litter filled ocean. Taken underwater, his color photographs show that this detritus isn’t only a surface manifestation buts exists at different depths.</p>

      <p>Mandy Barker mimics the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbor during the 1800's. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the bottom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures.</p>

      <p>One of Jason deCaires Taylor least seen but most impactful projects has been, since 2004, designing underwater installations of figurative sculpture intended to become artificial reefs. The works are constructed using pH neutral materials to instigate natural growth and the subsequent changes intended to explore the aesthetics of decay, rebirth and metamorphosis.  He also makes figures from collected refuse. <em>Clara</em>, 2016 is an accumulation of various washed ashore plastics.</p>

      <br>
      <p>Kelly Jazvac discovered a trove of indurated, multi-composite material made hard by agglutination of rock and molten plastic on Kamila Beach on the southeast shore of the island of Hawaii. The island’s location within the North Pacific subtropical gyre makes it vulnerable to acting as a sink for plastic debris. Kamilo Beach, located on the southeastern tip of the island of Hawaii, is notable for its accumulation of vast amounts of marine debris. Typical plastic debris include derelict fishing gear, including nets, oyster spacer tubes and buoys; food and drinking containers; resin pellets; and abundant multi-colored fragments or “plastic confetti”.  Partially melted polymers adhered to basalt outcrops included fishing nets, piping, bottle caps, and rubber tires. Locally, molten plastic had infilled vesicles in volcanic rock, thereby forming plastic amygdales. While volcanic disturbances on Hawaii are common, there is no evidence of lava flows in this region. This led Jazvac and two colleagues to determine that the formations were made from burning the plastics in beach campfires.</p>
      <p>Syracuse University undergraduate and graduate students are the exhibition’s principal audience for it is they who will bear the brunt of the outcomes from current climate policy decisions. We intend to, as with the earlier mentioned student constructed sperm whale and dory, involve students directly in the project. We’re also considering training students as docents to lead tours designed to encourage visitor conversations on local (Onondaga Lake) and global environmental subjects.</p>
      <p>In advance of the exhibition a web page will promote the show. After opening, working with Syracuse University’s Burton Blatt Institute, the page will become a web portal providing an interactive link enabling regional, national, international and special needs visitors to see and participate in the event.</p>
      <p>A comprehensive, illustrated catalog will accompany the exhibition that will examine intersections between Melville’s narrative and contemporary climate change. Artists, and humanist and scientific scholars will contribute commentaries from their perspectives which, in total, will present a more complete picture of the subject and its consequences.</p>
